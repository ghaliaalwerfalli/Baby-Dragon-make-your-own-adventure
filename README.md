# Baby-Dragon-make-your-own-adventure

Python Learning Project
An assignment I had to make after following with the lessons provided in 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro by Dr. Angela Yu .

## About this Project
 You follow a newly hatched baby dragon new to the world, trying to survive and find its happy ending with all the evil and monsters lerking in the corner. Gameplay will allow you to make a choice between 2 choices by typing either 1 or 2 and then you follow on with the story reaching the end.
